What's happening in the video :
1. Searching for the batch script
2. It opens a terminal and ask for a music name or link
3. Downloads it
4. Exit itself when done
5. Opens the directory where the music/video was downloaded

How to set this up?
1. Install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python</a>
2. Open cmd
3. Execute `pip install spotdl && pip install youtube-dl`
4. Download this repo's <a href="https://github.com/TyraVex/spotdl-youtube-dl-cli-shortcut/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">code</a>
5. Run the batch file you need
6. Give it a link/song name (only for spot.bat)
7. Enjoy!
